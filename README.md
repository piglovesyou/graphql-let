## Why it exists

One of the strengths of GraphQL is
[enforcing data types on runtime](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Value-Completion).
Further, TypeScript and
[GraphQL code generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) (graphql-codegen)
make it safer by typing data statically, so you can write truly type-protected
code with rich IDE assists.

To enhance that development pattern, we should move on to the more specific
use-case than what GraphQL code generator allows. Let's consider TypeScript as a
first-class citizen and forget generating intermediate artifacts to achieve Hot
Module Replacement (HMR).

graphql-let lets you `import` and call `gql` to get results of GraphQL code
generator per GraphQL documents with TypeScript type definitions.

```typescript jsx
import { useNewsQuery } from './news.graphql'

const News: React.FC = () => {
    // Typed already️⚡️
    const { data: { news } } = useNewsQuery()
    if (news) return <div>{news.map(...)}</div>
}
```

## How it works

There are three entrypoints to graphql-let: a CLI, a webpack loader and a Babel
plugin. Mostly, all do the same.

1.  It loads configurations from `.graphql-let.yml`
2.  It passes them to GraphQL code generator to get `.ts(x)`s, which runtime
    will use
3.  It generates `.d.ts` for the `.ts(x)`s, which your IDE and `tsc` will use

There are a few things it works on to make it happen fast and stable.

-   Sharing the processes. Loading remote schema and generating `.d.ts`s are
    heavy, so it runs them fewer times when it's possible.
-   Caching. By embedding hashes of source states, it reduces number of
    unnecessary compilation.
-   Sharing the promises. The webpack compilation of the typical SSR
    applications as Next.js runs `"node"` and `"web"` simultaniously. If sources
    are the same, the compilation should run once.

## Get started

This is an example of **TypeScript + React + Apollo Client on webpack**. Please
replace the corresponding lines depending on your needs.

### 1. Install dependencies

Note graphql-let is `devDependencies`.

```bash
npm install -D graphql-let @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/plugin-helpers @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations @graphql-codegen/typescript-react-apollo
npm install @apollo/react-common @apollo/react-components @apollo/react-hooks
```

### 2. Configure .graphql-let.yml

Run this command to generate a configuration template.

```bash
npx graphql-let init
# This will generate .graphql-let.yml
```

Next add
[graphql-codegen plugins](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/index)
in it. **Please note that you have to generate TypeScript source** by the
plugins.

Edit it like this:

```diff
 schema: lib/type-defs.graphqls
 documents: '**/*.graphql'
 plugins:
   - typescript
+  - typescript-operations
+  - typescript-react-apollo
```

### 3. Configure .gitignore

graphql-let will generate `.d.ts` files in the same folder of `.graphql`. Add
these lines in your .gitignore.

```diff
+*.graphql.d.ts
+*.graphqls.d.ts
```

### 4. Configure webpack.config.ts

The webpack loader also needs to be configured. Note that the content that
`graphql-let/loader` generates is JSX-TypeScript. You have to compile it to
JavaScript with an additional loader such as `babel-loader`.

```diff
 const config: Configuration = {
   module: {
     rules: [
+      {
+        test: /\.graphql$/,
+        use: [
+          { loader: 'babel-loader', options: { presets: ['@babel/preset-typescript', '@babel/preset-react'] } },
+          { loader: 'graphql-let/loader' },
+        ]
+      }
     ]
   }
 }
```

### 5. Generate type declarations

Run this to generate `.d.ts`.

```bash
npx graphql-let

# This will generate files such as:
#   - src/query.graphql.d.ts
#   - src/schema.graphqls.d.ts
```

By `--config` option you can specify the custom path to the `.graphql-let.yml`.
The directory .graphql-let.yml is located at is the basepath of the relative
paths in .grpahql-let.yml. Also, the basepath should be identical to **webpack's
`config.context`** so the loader can find the config file.

```bash
pwd # "/app"
npx graphql-let --config custom/path/.graphql-let.yml

# This will point paths such as:
# /app/custom/path/src/query.graphql.d.ts
# /app/custom/path/src/schema.graphqls.d.ts
```

You may want to run it everytime calling `tsc`. Please check your `package.json`
and modify like this.

```diff
   "scripts": {
-     "build": "tsc"
+     "build": "graphql-let && tsc"
   },
```

### 4. Code more

Enjoy HMR (Hot Module Replacement) of webpack with the generated react-apollo
hooks and IDE code assists.

```typescript jsx
import { useNewsQuery } from './news.graphql'

const News: React.FC = () => {
    // Already typed⚡️
    const { data: { news } } = useNewsQuery()
    if (news) return <div>{ news.map(...) }</div>
}
```

## Configuration options

graphql-let expects your `.graphql-let.yml` to look like this.

```yaml
schema: lib/type-defs.graphqls
# Required. The GraphQL schema info that graphql-let requests introspection to.
# Examples:
#       schema: http://localhost:3000/graphql
#       schema: schema.json
#       schema: schema.graphqls  # Note: glob is not supported yet
#       schema:
#           https://api.github.com/graphql
#               headers:
#                   Authorization: "YOUR-TOKEN"
# Please see here for more information: https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started/schema-field#available-formats

documents: "**/*.graphql"
# Necessary if you use a webpack loader "graphql-let/loader".
# The GraphQL documents info of quereis and mutations etc.
# Examples:
#            documents: 'queries/**/*.graphql'
#            documents:
#                - 'queries/**/*.graphql'
#                - '!queries/exeption.graphql'

plugins:
    - typescript
    - typescript-operations
    - typescript-react-apollo
# Required. The plugins for GraphQL documents to run GraphQL code generator with.
# It's identical to "documentPlugins" field. Please note you need to generate TypeScript source here.
# Examples:
#            plugins:
#                - typescript
#                - typescript-react-apollo
#                - add: "/* eslint-disable */"
# See here for more information. https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/index

config:
    - withHOC: false
    - withHooks: true
# Optional. Shared options for document plugins.
# See here for more information. https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started/config-field

respectGitIgnore: true
# Optional. `true` by default. If true, graphql-let will ignore files in .gitignore.
# Useful to prevent parsing files in such as `node_modules`.

cacheDir: node_modules/graphql-let/__generated__
# Optional. `node_modules/graphql-let/__generated__` by default.
# graphql-let takes care of intermediate outpus `.ts(x)`s of GraphQL code generator but still need to
# store them somewhere for caching and TypeScript API purposes. This is the directory these files go to.
# Examples:
#            cacheDir: __generated__

TSConfigFile: tsconfig.json
# Optional. `tsconfig.json` by default. You can specify a custom config for generating `.d.ts`s.
# Examples:
#            TSConfigFile: tsconfig.compile.json

gqlDtsEntrypoint: node_modules/@types/graphql-let/index.d.ts
# Optional. `node_modules/@types/graphql-let/index.d.ts` by default. Needs to be end with ".d.ts".
# It is used if you use a Babel plugin "graphql-let/babel" to inject types of a `gql` function.
```

## Jest Transformer

"graphql-let/jestTransformer" is available. Configure your `jest.config.js` as:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    transform: {
        "\\.(graphql|graphqls)$": "graphql-let/jestTransformer",
    },
};
```

Please note:

-   You need to run the `graphql-let` command before calling `jest`.
    `graphql-let/jestTransformer` will use generated intermediate files as
    `.tsx`.
-   `babel-jest` is a default subsequent transformer. In this case, you'll want
    `babel.config.js` to transform the TypeScript source.
-   Customize it by a `subsequentTransformer` option. This is useful when you
    use `ts-jest` and don't want additional babel config. In that case, your
    config will look like this:

```javascript
const { defaults: tsjPreset } = require("ts-jest/presets");

module.exports = {
    preset: "ts-jest",
    transform: {
        ...tsjPreset.transform,
        "\\.(graphql|graphqls)$": [
            "graphql-let/jestTransformer",
            { subsequentTransformer: "ts-jest" },
        ],
    },
};
```

## Babel Plugin for inline GraphQL documents

A Babel Plugin support allows you to get typed graphql-codegen results from
"graphql-tag"-like syntax as the below.

```typescript jsx
import gql from "graphql-let";

// Typed️⚡️
const { useViewerQuery } = gql(`
    query Viewer {
        viewer { name }
    }
`);
```

### Configuration

Install these additional dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D graphql-let do-sync @babel/core @babel/parser @babel/traverse @babel/helper-plugin-utils
```

with the plugin configuration in such as `babel.config.json`:

```json
{
    "plugins": ["graphql-let/babel"]
}
```

Note: The `.tsx`s are generated in `node_modules/graphql-let/__generated__` by
default, but you may want them to be outside of `node_modules`.Please try
`cacheDir: __generated__` in your .graphql-let.yml then.

### Limitations

-   **Sadly**, type injection can't be done with TaggedTemplateExpression such
    as `` gql`query {}` ``. This is the limitation of TypeScript.
    [Please answer me if you have ideas.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61917066/can-taggedtempalte-have-overload-signatures-with-a-certain-string-literal-argume)
-   Fragments are still not available. Please watch
    [the issue.](https://github.com/piglovesyou/graphql-let/issues/65)

## Experimental feature: Resolver Types

If:

-   your `schema` in .graphql-let.yml points to a single local GraphQL schema
    file (`.graphqls`)
-   you have installed
    [`@graphql-codegen/typescript-resolvers`](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/typescript-resolvers)
    in dependencies

, graphql-let will generate `.graphqls.d.ts` to help you type your GraphQL
resolvers. Run:

```bash
npm install -D @graphql-codegen/typescript-resolvers

npx graphql-let
```

then you will get `Resolver` type from the schema file.

```typescript
import { Resolvers } from "./type-defs.graphqls";

const resolvers: Resolvers = {
  Query: {
    // All typed⚡️
    viewer(parent, args, context, info) {
      return { ... }
    },
  }
};

export default resolvers;
```

`graphql-let/schema/loader` is also available. It just pass GraphQL Content to
the next loader but it updates resolver types in HMR. Set it up as below:

```diff
 const config: Configuration = {
   module: {
     rules: [
+      {
+        test: /\.graphqls$/,
+        use: [
+          { loader: 'graphql-tag/loader' },
+          { loader: 'graphql-let/schema/loader' },
+        ]
+      }
     ]
   }
 }
```

## FAQ

#### So, it's just a graphql-codegen wrapper generating `d.ts`...?

_Yes._

#### What's the difference between webpack loader and Babel Plugin?

The webpack loader is more stable, the Babel Plagin can handle inline GraphQL
documents.

#### Is this a tool only for React?

No. There are
[more plugins that also generates `.ts(x)`s from GraphQL documents](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/).

#### Can I write GraphQL documents in my `.tsx` as `` const query = gql`query News{ ... }`; ``?

Please try the Babel Plugin, that'd let you have a close experience.

#### What's the extension `.graphqls`? Should I use it for schema and `.graphql` for documents?

Not exactly, but I'd recommend them. I think using different extensions for
schema/documents leads to a more understandable configuration for webpack
loaders with fewer pitfalls. Another reason for `.graphqls` is that it's one of
[the supported extensions in the internal library](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-toolkit/blob/d29e518a655c02e3e14377c8c7d3de61f08e6200/packages/loaders/graphql-file/src/index.ts#L9).

#### How to integrate Apollo refetchQueries?

[Query document exports `DocumentNode` named `${QueryName}Document` that you can make use of.](https://github.com/piglovesyou/graphql-let/issues/66#issuecomment-596276493)

#### How to import `.graphql` from another, to import GraphQL Fragment for example?

You can't, yet.
